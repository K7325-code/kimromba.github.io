    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Kim and I'm 17 years old. I was born in Maryland, grew up abroad and when I came back, I moved up north to New Hampshire where I graduated from. I wrote a book when I was in middle school and I'm fluent in English and French and I'm profecient in Spanish as well. I enjoy going out with my friends and staying indoors with my pet turltes. I love spending quality time with my family as well as reading a good book during a stormy weather. I dream of being a factor of change in whatever I work in someday.
