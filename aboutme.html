    <h1>Get to know me!</h1>
  
    <p>Hey there, my name is <strong>Kim</strong> and I'm from <strong>New Hampshire</strong>. I'm trilingual and grew up in a beautiful country call Cote D'Ivoire before moving to New Hampshire. I have 1 biological sister and 4 adoptive sisters which makes us 6 total. I haev traveled to 4 out of 7 continents and can't wait to visit more. Here are a couple things that I'm passionate about and I could do it all day long:
        <ul>- <em>Reading</em>: it eanbles me to dream and delve into the imaginary <br>
            - <em>Watching comedy or horror shows</em>: I love humor and thriller, it relaxes me<br>
            - <em>Shopping</em>: with a good savings, it's relaxing to buy new goods<br>
            - <em>Hanging out with loved ones</em>: there's nothing more special than those memories whith cherished ones <br>
            This web page will help get to know me a bit more and the things I enjoy doing everyday that make me who I am as a seventeen year old. 

        </ul>
