   <p>I'm currently an undergrad student at URI majoring in political science and minoring in computer science. As you go through this website, you will get to see the things I enjoy doing outside of the classroom. As much as I love learning and saturating my mind with new facts, I also appreciate a good time, doing nothing just to clear my mind for example.</p>
